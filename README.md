Loot
====

Loot, the card game, (http://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-231-Loot/dp/B0009XBY30) is one of our favorite games. We had a couple of weeks on our hands and decided to build bots to compete against each other.

This repo includes two parts: 
* Loot engine to host games
* Various AIs that we built to compete against each other

You can also use the engine to have one AI participate in a physical game with a human interpreter (though the interface is a little bit clunky).

PS: we apologize for limited documentation. It was mostly built for us to have some fun and given that Loot is copyrighted, we didn't think spreading this around would really add any value to the world. (Thus, we never spent much time on documentation).
